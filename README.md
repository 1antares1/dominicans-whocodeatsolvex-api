# SOLVEX-whocode-API
The idea is to have this space where you could find the Dominican and foreign devs info. This project is basically everybody who want to collaborate to learn/use some of the main backend platforms (.NET Core), play with some WebAssembly technologies like Blazor and also implement a Microservices Architecture.
